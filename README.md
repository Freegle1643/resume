## JSON File Usage

### config.json

See the following example:

    {
        "lang":{
            "en":{
                "constStr":"./constStr_en.json",
                "content":"./content_en.json"
            },
            "cn":{
                "constStr":"./constStr_cn.json",
                "content":"./content_cn.json"
            }
        },
        "defaultLang":"en"
    }

The object "lang" is a set of languages you want, in each sub-object, the directory of config files of the language is declared.

The "defaultLang" is the default language you want to show in your online github-pages static resume. And the online version has a front-end router which can swith the display language, for example, if you want the chinese version, visit "/#/cn" route.
